									In the Windows File explorer simply navigate to Z:\Menus\ and then double click Menu Creator. You should see something similiar to the image on the left.
								</p><p>
									To start, select what menu you would like to edit and update, using the radio boxes on the top left of the program.
									Once selected, press Edit. This will take you into Excel where you can change anything and everything about the menu!

            <h2 class="mb-4">The Knowhow of Excel</h2>
            <p>Stories are told of a legendary man who knows Excel formulas by heart and doesn't need to Google for them.</p>
          </div>
				</div>
				<div class="row">
					<h2 class="mb-4">Some Pointers</h2>
					<p>In Excel, simply select and edit what ever menu item you need to change. But there are a few things you need to follow.</p>
					<p>1: Company names are purple and begin with a number following their bin number</p>
					<p>2: Product names are green and begin with a letter following their bin letter</p>
					<p>3: When a product is no longer in stock, remove it. Don't do a strikethrough. This will cause the menu to eventually fill up with out of stock products and can potentially rile up shitty customers.</p>
					<p>4: Uniformity is grand. Try to make sure each column of products looks clean and try as best as you can to make sure that each column is even to the best of your abilities. Sometimes you can't always do that, when that happens make sure to fill in the left most column first and then the remaining columns.</p>
			  	<p>5: Excel is basically just a shitty word document. Don't be intimadated with its boxes and vastly useless interface.</p>

						<h2 class="mb-4">The  Outline</h2>
					<p>The outline that I use on the menus is very simple to add in. Highlight the entire column of products that you need to change the outline for. Do not select more than one column or things will get a tad messy.
						Once selected, there's a small square button directly below the Font Size selector and to the left of the Paint bucket fill too. Click the little arrow that points down next to it. You should see a popup with some selectios. At the very bottom you will see the option 'More Borders', click that.
						Now, make sure that the Color selector shows your color. If it does not click it and its the purple of the right side of the bottom row. And you will get an outline! Press OK and you will be taken back to the border menu.
						If the little display on the side shows a solid line, that means that part of the column already has the proper border. If it shows no line, or a checkered grey line that means the border is not on the part and needs to be added. Simply click the little square that matches what side of the column you want to
						add the border to until it shows a solid line. And that's it!
					</p>
					<p>I normally do the top, bottom, and right sides of the column with borders leaving the left side without one.</p>

            <h2 class="mb-4">Creating Our Menu For The TVs</h2>
            <p>Didn't we just do that?</p>
          </div>
        </div><p>
			In order to upload it to the TVs all you have to do is nothing! Uploading is handled by the MenuCreator! When you create your menu just simply make sure that 'Automatically Upload' is checked and sit back and relax!
			</p>>
				<p>(OUTDATED)Now you may be asking yourself, 'Joe wtf I just had to spend my whole afternoon learning Excel, and you're saying were not done?'. Yeah, that's exactly what I'm saying.
					Once you finished editing in Excel save and close Excel. Return to the Menu Creator program, (which hopefully is still open), and press the big button, 'Create Image'.
					Our TVs, while being 'smart', are dumb. And can only accept certain file formats. The Menu Creator was hand made to turn and Excel Spreadsheet into a crisp, clean, image file that the TVs can display.
					Once the image has been created a preview of it should appear in the program. Make sure that the whole menu is visible. If something looks like it got cut off, below the preview you will see 'Image Settings'.
					For Excel Range you will want to adjust the second box. The letter Dictates how far to the right the image will show and the number is how far down. So for example it says U40, and my image has a little bit cut off on the bottom,
					you will adjust the 40 to something like 42 or 43. Once you change it hit save and then 'Create Image' again. And see if the preview is any better.
				</p><p>
					Once you have the image how you want, press 'Open Web Page', this will take you to a special website I made to one stop manage all of the menus and what images they display.
					Select the Menu you want to adjust and give it a second to load up. Once loaded, you will see a page displaying 'Assets'. Assets are compatible files that the TVs can display. I like to delete old ones but its not needed.
					In the upper right hand side of the page, you will see a big blue button that says 'Add Asset'. Press that, then Upload, then Add Files. You will see a popup asking you to locate the menu you just created.
					It will be located on your desktop. The file should be named 'menuname'_Date.png or somethign similiar to that. Select it and it will return you to the upload screen. Once the loading bar finishes the asset will now be available on that intial page. Press back to assets to return.
				</p><p>
					Find you new asset and switch it from 'Off' to 'On' and then the old active asset from 'On' to 'Off'. After roughly 22 seconds your new menu should be up on the TV! Congrates you did it!

            <p>Normal people are the most special people, that's why God made so many. /s</p>
					</div>
					<div class="row">
						<p>Daily specials are in essence, the same as a normal menu. You edit an excel file, create an image, and upload it to the TVs.</br>
						They are different however, in the fact that its placed onto another image to make it pretty. At the time of writting, this image was a green chalkboard.</br>
					Things to note about the daily specials menu:</p>
				<p>1: You need to follow the font/color directions in the excel file. As things change these will be altered to match the background.</p>
			<p>2: The image creation is still experimental. Testing has shown reliable results with no complications, but please keep that in mind.</p>

            <p>Shit happens. Just make sure you move the fan out of the way.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="row">
						<p>Here are some common issues you may run into while working on menus:</p>
						<p>1: Failed To Create Image. If Menu Creator tells you that it failed to create the image or shows some sort of 'Copy Range' error. Close out of all other programs other than MenuC reator and try again.
							Some programs like to lock Menu Creator out of using the Copy/Paste functions and so you just gotta get rid of everything that stands in your way.
						</p>
						<p>
							2: File Not Found. File not found error when going to open the WebPage for the TVs. This can happen rarely, but it is an easy fix. Windows doesn't like to load server drives sometimes, so all you have to do is in explorer open up the Z drive and close it and try again.
						</p>
						<p>3: Should I export in 4k? Yes always export the image in 4K.</p>
