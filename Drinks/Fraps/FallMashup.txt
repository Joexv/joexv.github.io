-  Vanilla Bean Frappuccino
- Add pumpkin spice sauce (1 pump tall and grande, 2 pumps venti)
- Add toffee nut syrup (½ pump tall, 1 grande, 1.5 venti)
- Top with whip, caramel drizzle, mocha syrup and sea salt

**Even after the season is over and pumpkin spice sauce is no longer available, the recipe is still quite tasty without it. Just up the toffee nut syrup and you’re good to go.
