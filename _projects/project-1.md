AuraScreen is a dynamic and customizable accessibility tool, engineered specifically to tackle the challenges faced by users experiencing eye floaters. Recognizing the impact of prolonged screen exposure, I developed AuraScreen to be an adaptable solution that empowers users to personalize their screen settings for a more comfortable experience.

### Highlights
- **Adaptive Visual Control**: AuraScreen offers extensive customization with adjustable brightness, contrast, and filter options, allowing users to fine-tune their screen environment to minimize eye strain and reduce discomfort.
- **User-Centered Design**: With an intuitive interface and thoughtful feature set, AuraScreen ensures ease of use, reflecting my commitment to designing tools that are both practical and accessible.
- **Innovative Problem Solving**: Built using C#, AuraScreen stands as a testament to my ability to craft solutions that address unique user needs through non-invasive, software-based approaches.

AuraScreen represents my approach to creating accessible, practical software that makes a real difference in users’ daily lives. This project brought together my programming skills and my focus on intuitive design, allowing me to address a unique need with a solution that’s both effective and user-friendly.
