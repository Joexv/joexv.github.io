summary: A fun text style converter for iOS, inspired by cringe internet culture
---

**OwOer** is a lighthearted, customizable text converter designed to bring creativity to everyday messaging. Ever wanted to add that extra flair to your comments or posts without relying on those sketchy text generator websites? OwOer lets you transform your text in fun and unique ways, directly from your iOS device—no need for a jailbreak or web tool.

### Purpose and Inspiration
OwOer was inspired by the popular *uwu* and *OwO* internet styles and tweaks like Nepeta's *UWU* tweak. However, OwOer takes it to the next level, giving users an easy way to stylize their messages across different social media apps, iMessages, and more. It's about bringing expressive, playful language styles right to your fingertips in a user-friendly app.

### Key Features
- **Multiple Text Styles**: OwOer comes packed with options, from the iconic "OwO" to the ever-popular clap emoji between words. With more styles being added over time, OwOer aims to be the ultimate toolbox for message customization.
- **Seamless Integration Across iOS**: The app includes a main UI, a custom keyboard, and an iMessage extension, making it easy to use across different contexts without switching apps.
- **User-Friendly Design**: Featuring an intuitive layout, even users new to text styling can easily navigate and enjoy converting their text with OwOer. Whether you want to "uwuify" your messages or add a unique touch to your posts, the app is designed to make it fun and accessible.

### Technical Overview
- **Built in Swift**: Leveraging Swift and targeting iOS 10+, OwOer is optimized for Apple’s ecosystem, offering a smooth, responsive user experience.
- **Centralized Text Functions**: The core of OwOer’s functionality lies in `TextFunctions.swift`, which stores all the conversion algorithms. Both the main application and iMessage extension call this class for consistency across platforms.
- **Customizability**: OwOer allows users to experiment with different text styles, and I’m continually expanding its capabilities with new styles based on user feedback and popular internet trends.

### Fun and Functionality Combined
OwOer is more than just a text converter—it’s a playful way to add personality to your digital conversations. While it might not solve world hunger, OwOer does solve the problem of boring messages by giving users the power to express themselves in unique and amusing ways. From its streamlined design to its wide range of styles, OwOer provides an easy, fun way to embrace internet culture right from your device.
