summary: My series of Mini Pokemon ROM hacks
---

Growing up immersed in the world of Pokémon, I was inspired early on to create my own experiences within the games I loved. My dad’s passion for gaming, combined with my formative years in Japan, introduced me to Pokémon almost from birth. This fascination fueled a lifelong passion for game development, leading me to start my journey with Pokémon ROM hacking.

Although I didn’t have access to traditional game development tools, I found a way through ROM hacking, diving deep into the code of Game Boy Advance games. Throughout my teenage years, I created a series of Pokémon ROM hacks and built tools to support the ROM hacking community, learning the fundamentals of programming along the way.

### Technical Development and Community Impact
ROM hacking served as my first practical encounter with programming, where I tackled Assembly, C, and eventually C# to bring my ideas to life. I designed several tools in C# that simplified the ROM hacking process, contributing to the community’s resources and empowering other creators to realize their own visions.

#### Notable Hacks
Over the years, I developed a number of unique Pokémon hacks, each one exploring different themes, stories, and gameplay mechanics:
- **[Holiday Hacks](https://www.pokecommunity.com/showthread.php?t=339585)**: A collection of mini-hacks, each themed around various holidays with unique stories and settings.
- **[Blackened Night](https://www.pokecommunity.com/showthread.php?t=302424)**: My first full Pokémon ROM hack, an ambitious story-driven project (in progress).
- **[A New Dawn](https://www.pokecommunity.com/showthread.php?t=359943)**: A standalone sequel to *Blackened Night*, expanding on its storyline and character arcs.
- **[Gentlemon](https://www.pokecommunity.com/showthread.php?t=368132)**: A lighthearted sprite mod, reimagining Pokémon as “dapper af” characters in top hats and monocles.
- **[Camp Baker](https://www.pokecommunity.com/showthread.php?t=321555)**: Inspired by my time working at a Boy Scout summer camp, this hack integrates personal stories and humor.

#### Tool Development for ROM Hackers
To support other developers, I created several tools aimed at simplifying common ROM hacking tasks:
- **[Hex Helper](https://www.pokecommunity.com/showthread.php?t=338884)**: A utility for quickly adding standard hex edits, streamlining the process for both beginners and experienced hackers.
- **[Magic Backup](https://www.pokecommunity.com/showthread.php?t=388547)**: An automatic backup system for active ROM projects, providing peace of mind by creating regular save points.
- **[Instant Pokémon Transfer System](https://www.pokecommunity.com/showthread.php?t=361135)**: A mass import/export tool that enables hackers to move Pokémon data between ROMs easily.
- **[A-Offset](https://www.pokecommunity.com/showthread.php?t=347441)**: A tool designed to locate lost offsets in any game using Big-endian formats, essential for finding functions, tables, and other game data.

### Reflection on the Journey
Building these hacks and tools not only deepened my programming skills but also fostered a deeper understanding of game mechanics, design, and user experience. Each hack taught me new ways to engage players, while the tools I created helped support a thriving community of fellow Pokémon fans and developers. This journey from a Pokémon-loving kid to a tool developer laid the foundation for my ongoing career in game development, where technical skills meet creativity and community.
