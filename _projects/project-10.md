Tired of seeing that same generic browser icon for every website shortcut on your desktop? **ICO Enumerator 5000** is here to help. This straightforward command-line utility grabs a fitting icon for each website directly from [icon.horse](https://icon.horse/) and sets it up for you—no need to search, download, and apply icons manually. 

Whether you're aiming for a more organized, visually appealing desktop or just want a touch of personality for your shortcuts, ICO Enumerator 5000 makes it easy.

### Key Features
- **Automated Icon Retrieval**: Pulls website-specific icons automatically from icon.horse, saving you the hassle of hunting for icons yourself.
- **Easy Command-Line Usage**: With a simple command-line interface, ICO Enumerator 5000 is lightweight, fast, and easy to use.
- **Streamlines Desktop Organization**: Transforms the look of your desktop by giving each shortcut a unique, relevant icon instead of the standard browser image.

### How It Works
ICO Enumerator 5000 connects to icon.horse, a web service that provides high-quality icons for thousands of websites. By specifying the URL of a website, this tool downloads the appropriate PNG and applies it as the icon for the corresponding shortcut on your desktop. Built in C#, it’s designed for speed and simplicity—making desktop customization easier than ever.

### Why I Built It
The project started as a fun way to avoid the visual monotony of generic browser icons, especially for people who rely heavily on website shortcuts. This utility streamlines the whole process, offering a quick and convenient way to personalize your desktop without manually managing icons.

ICO Enumerator 5000 is a simple tool, but one that makes a big difference for those who appreciate a cleaner, more visually distinctive workspace.
