summary: The Official FlorkOfCows Sticker Pack!
---

The only officially licensed FlorkOfCows sticker pack! This project brought the beloved, quirky sock puppet comics from MS Paint to life on iOS, Android, and LINE, transforming iconic characters into a versatile sticker pack with over 300 unique options. Designed to amplify any conversation, FlorkOfStickers combines humor, creativity, and a touch of the absurd, bringing out the playful side of digital messaging.

### Project Highlights
- **Diverse Sticker Selection**: With over 300 stickers, FlorkOfStickers captures a range of moods and personalities—whether it's a sock in existential crisis, an anime-loving character, or a crusading sock hero, there’s something for everyone. This variety encourages users to express themselves in fun, unexpected ways.
- **True-to-Source Artwork**: Every sticker retains the original charm of Flork’s MS Paint style, faithfully preserving the hand-drawn aesthetic that fans adore. Each character was reimagined in sticker format, ensuring that users feel connected to the authentic, quirky humor of FlorkOfCows.
- **Fan-Centric Design**: Made with fans in mind, FlorkOfStickers is an homage to the original characters, thoughtfully curated to maintain the wit and whimsy that defines the Flork universe. The user-friendly interface and seamless integration across platforms make it easy for fans to find and share their favorite stickers.
- **Licensed Collaboration with Flork**: Partnered with Flork himself to deliver an officially approved and fan-endorsed product. The collaboration involved close communication to ensure the stickers met Flork’s standards, preserving the humor, subtlety, and occasional absurdity of the source material.

FlorkOfStickers was an exciting challenge, letting me bring a beloved internet comic into the world of digital messaging. From collaborating with Flork himself to translating the humor and style of these characters into a sticker format, this project was all about creating something fans would genuinely enjoy using every day.
