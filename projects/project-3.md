summary: A toolkit for end users to fix their mistakes
---

Tired of constantly being interrupted by coworkers asking you to troubleshoot their printers every five minutes? I certainly was. That's why I developed a simple solution: the MayDay Button.

If you're like me and find it frustrating to be pulled away from your tasks by repetitive and menial requests, the MayDay Button is your saving grace. Designed to empower end users to resolve common IT issues themselves, this intuitive button executes essential troubleshooting commands with just a single click.

Imagine dealing with a stubborn receipt printer that refuses to cooperate. With the MayDay Button, users can reset printer tasks, clear spools, and even receive helpful notifications to address common issues, such as low paper levels. It's about teaching self-reliance and freeing up your time to enjoy the moments that matter.

Featuring a user-friendly interface with an unmistakable "MAYDAY!" button, even the least tech-savvy individuals can navigate its functionality effortlessly. Plus, with three customizable buttons, adapting to different software environments is a breeze.

But the MayDay Button doesn't stop there. As an IT professional, you'll appreciate its advanced features, including remote command execution via local TCP connection, instant notifications for critical events, and seamless communication through private Slack chats – all accessible directly from the workstation.

Say goodbye to constant interruptions and reclaim your time with the MayDay Button – your ultimate tool for streamlining IT support and empowering end users to troubleshoot with confidence (and safety).
