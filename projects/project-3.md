summary: A toolkit for end users to fix their mistakes
---

Ever feel like you’re a magnet for every printer and tech issue in the office? I did, which led me to develop the **MayDay Button**: a toolkit that gives end users the power to troubleshoot common IT issues on their own and lets IT staff focus on more pressing problems.

MayDay Button is designed to address the types of interruptions IT professionals face daily, empowering users to solve their own problems with just a single click.

### Core Functionality
- **One-Click Fixes**: With a large, unmistakable "MAYDAY!" button, users can reset devices, clear printer spools, and get back to work without needing assistance. This instantly solves common issues like frozen printers or unresponsive software, saving time for everyone.
- **Self-Reliance through Simplicity**: The interface is straightforward, allowing even those with minimal tech experience to troubleshoot confidently. Alongside the main button, there are three customizable buttons for adapting to specific software environments, making MayDay Button as versatile as it is easy to use.
  
### Advanced Features for IT Professionals
For IT teams, MayDay Button isn’t just about reducing interruptions—it’s a tool that streamlines support:
- **Remote Command Execution**: IT can send commands directly to workstations over a secure TCP connection, offering quick fixes without leaving their desks.
- **Real-Time Alerts**: Receive instant notifications for critical events, enabling proactive response to potential issues before they escalate.
- **Slack Integration**: Built-in communication tools let IT chat privately with users directly from their workstations, making problem-solving even faster.

### Why It’s Effective
MayDay Button encourages a culture of self-sufficiency in the workplace, helping users address minor problems themselves while allowing IT to concentrate on complex tasks. This tool cuts down on repetitive tasks and frees up time for meaningful work. 

Developing the MayDay Button taught me the value of intuitive design paired with powerful functionality. It’s a solution that not only addresses immediate issues but also reduces the need for constant IT support, creating a smoother, more efficient workplace.
