In this level design project, created for my Game Design course, players explore the eerie beauty of an abandoned Japanese forest inspired by the legendary temples of Nara. Built in Unreal Engine 5.3, the level blends atmospheric visuals and exploration-focused gameplay to immerse players in a world shaped by cultural reverence and mystery.

### Level Concept and Gameplay
The level guides players through overgrown paths and ancient ruins, using light as a natural wayfinding tool. Collectible Lucky Cats are hidden throughout the environment, rewarding curiosity and exploration with subtle secrets and worldbuilding. The result is a calm, reflective experience that encourages players to slow down and take in the surroundings.

### Design and Technical Elements
**Cultural Inspiration**
Architecture and landscape design draw from Nara’s seven great temples, blending spiritual and historical elements to build a setting with weight and purpose.

**Atmospheric Visuals**
Leveraging UE5.3’s lighting features, the level uses fog, ambient audio, and natural light direction to create immersion and guide exploration organically.

**Player-Led Discovery**
No combat or time limits—just player curiosity. Subtle visual cues and collectibles reward thorough exploration and attention to detail.
