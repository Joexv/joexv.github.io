summary: Level design project focusing on atmospheric exploration and cultural motifs
---

In this level design project, developed as part of my Project and Portfolio II Game Design course, players are invited to explore the eerie beauty of an abandoned Japanese forest, drawing inspiration from the legendary temples of Nara. Crafted in Unreal Engine 5.3, this mini-game level combines atmospheric visuals with exploration-driven gameplay to create an immersive experience that brings the mystical elements of Japanese culture to life.

### Level Concept and Gameplay
The level’s core design focuses on guiding players through dense foliage and ancient ruins, where light serves as a guiding element, leading them deeper into the mysterious landscape. Players can discover collectible Lucky Cats scattered across the environment, encouraging exploration and rewarding curiosity with hidden secrets. This fusion of cultural motifs and gameplay not only enhances the level’s aesthetic appeal but also creates a sense of discovery as players uncover the mysteries of these forgotten forests.

### Design and Technical Elements
- **Inspired by Japanese Heritage**: The level architecture and environmental details draw from the seven great temples of Nara, blending historical and spiritual elements to evoke a sense of reverence and mystery.
- **Atmospheric Lighting and Visuals**: Using Unreal Engine 5.3’s advanced lighting and rendering capabilities, the level leverages fog, ambient sounds, and directional light to guide players and enhance immersion.
- **Exploration-Driven Gameplay**: By integrating collectibles and subtle visual cues, players are encouraged to navigate the terrain at their own pace, creating a rewarding experience for those who seek out every hidden corner.
