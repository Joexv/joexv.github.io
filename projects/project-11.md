## Japanese Garden Level  
*Game Design Coursework – Unreal Engine 5.3*  
**Role: Level Designer / Environment Artist**

---

### Overview  
A solo level design project focused on crafting a quiet, spiritual environment using Japanese temple architecture and forest motifs. The goal was to create a space that rewarded curiosity, set a meditative tone, and guided players using only natural elements—light, layout, and landscape.

### Concept & Research  
I drew reference from Nara’s legendary temples, Shinto and Buddhist design cues, and the way nature overtakes architecture in forgotten spaces. This wasn’t meant to be “accurate” — it was designed to *feel* reverent, lost, and peaceful.

- Focused on indirect storytelling through ruins and props  
- Used natural sightlines and elevation to hint at paths  
- Aimed for serenity, not challenge

### Key Design Goals  
- Use light and structure to guide players without HUD  
- Encourage freeform exploration with soft gating  
- Hide collectibles (Lucky Cats) that reward environmental attention

---

### Development Breakdown

#### Blockout Phase  
- Built initial pass with splines and modular temple kits  
- Tested pathfinding with minimal assets to ensure flow felt intuitive  
- Sightline anchors placed early to hint at objectives or interesting areas

#### Art Pass  
- Custom lighting blend: fog, low-angle sunlight, particle embers  
- Decals, moss, and foliage placed to imply age and neglect  
- Adjusted color palette to shift subtly over areas (cool → warm)

#### Gameplay Layer  
- Collectibles placed off-path or near visual landmarks  
- Player movement speed tweaked to slow exploration naturally  
- No combat—player is here to observe, not disrupt

---

### What Worked  
- Natural guidance via light and layout was successful—players rarely got lost  
- Environmental storytelling (collapsed archways, offerings) added depth  
- Mood stayed consistent from start to finish

### What Didn’t  
- Frame rate dipped with dynamic shadows and too much foliage  
- Some geometry broke immersion up close (low-res rock meshes)  
- Collectible placement could be more meaningfully tied to story themes

---

### Summary  
This level taught me the value of restraint in level design. Instead of filling space with gameplay, I focused on shaping mood, flow, and emotion. Sometimes the best play experience is just *being* in a space that feels alive.
