## Mystic Fishing  
*30-Day Game Jam â€“ Ryan Laley Games 2024*  
**Role: Level Designer / Gameplay Systems Designer**

### Overview  
Built during a brutal month of balancing school and development, Mystic Fishing aimed to blend mythological storytelling with systemic gameplay. You play as a lone fisherman in icy Nordic waters, hunting ancient creatures of legend. We didnâ€™t have time for full boss fights or lore progressionâ€”but we built a polished vertical slice showcasing atmosphere, fishing mechanics, and exploration.

### Original Concept  
We originally pitched a myth-tracking, world-exploring fishing epic:
- Discover scattered lore about ancient mythic fish
- Prepare with bait, tools, and environmental knowledge
- Engage in boss-level showdowns Ã  la *Moby Dick*

### What We Actually Built  
With 30 days and school deadlines, we narrowed focus:
- A single handcrafted Nordic ocean zone  
- Harpoon-based quick-time fishing combat  
- A bait economy and fish behavior system  
- Atmospheric audio zones and environment triggers

---

### Development Breakdown

#### Week 1 â€“ Pitch to Pivot  
We immediately realized the scope was too large. Instead of cutting features later, we trimmed upfront and focused on a strong vertical slice.

#### Week 2 â€“ Systems First  
- Designed spline-based ocean layout  
- Procedural fish spawns tied to bait type  
- Physics-driven boat controls tuned for immersion

#### Week 3 â€“ Combat Prototype  
Combat went through multiple prototypes:
- Click-to-time throws  
- Directional mouse QTEs  
- A drift-lock harpoon throw that added tension (final version)

#### Week 4 â€“ Final Pass  
We focused on environmental polish:
- Ambient fog and sound zones  
- Music blending by location  
- Trade economy and lore nodes (partially implemented)

---

### Deliverables  
- Playable fishing loop with four fish types and bait interactions  
- Responsive boat movement and fishing QTE  
- Atmospheric exploration in a compact but immersive world

### Lessons Learned

**What Worked**  
- Modular systems made it easy to adapt and trim  
- Scope control early kept us focused  
- Emphasis on vibe and pacing helped it stand out

**What Didnâ€™t**  
- No time for the big boss-style fish fights  
- Tutorial elements were light, players felt a bit lost  
- Audio and UI were functional but not final quality

---

### Summary  
Mystic Fishing is a lesson in disciplined scoping and modular design. While the game didnâ€™t fully realize the myth-hunting fantasy, it nailed the tone, loop, and pacing we set out to testâ€”under heavy constraints.
