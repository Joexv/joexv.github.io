### Mystic Fishing â€“ Ryan Laley Games Game Jam 2024
**Role: Level Designer / Gameplay Systems Designer**

Set in a tranquil Nordic-inspired world, *Mystic Fishing* invites players to explore icy waters in search of ancient mythological fish. Built in Unreal Engine, the game blends calm exploration with interactive, skill-based harpoon fishing. I was responsible for level layout, boat movement and control, water and fish spawning systems, and early mechanical/world concepting.

Initially pitched as a time-traveling fishing adventure through multiple mythologies, the project evolved into a focused vertical sliceâ€”emphasizing exploration, rune-based fish combat, and trading. Despite cuts to some of the original scope, core mechanics such as mouse-based quick-time harpoon duels, a working bait-and-trade economy, and dynamic music/environment systems were implemented and showcased.

### Key Contributions:
- **Level Design**: Built the explorable ocean environment, including the merchant shack, rare fish zones, and player guidance layout.
- **Boat and Water Physics**: Designed and tuned boat controls for smooth traversal; integrated physical water response.
- **Spawning and Economy Systems**: Created a modular fish spawning system with rarity scaling tied to zone and bait; connected core loop of catching â†’ selling â†’ upgrading bait.
- **Audio & Mood**: Set up layered ambient music triggers and environment blending for a calm, mythic vibe.
- **Narrative & Concept**: Pitched the original story idea of traveling through mythologies with a magical fishing grimoire. While the final game shifted directions, the early tone and lore foundations remain.
