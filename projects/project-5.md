summary: Two incredibly useful programs for making menus
---

This project was made to make my life a little easier. 
90% of my job as an in house IT person for a dispensary I am updating menus on TVs And at first this consisted of, making excel files, manually converting them into pictures, putting thme on flash drives and walking them out to all of our TVs. This got boring after a while so I setup some Pi Zeros with Screenly OSE and made MenuCreator The only job this program has is to automate making thos images and to give me easy access to all the Excel files and Screenly links I need.

StrainMenuCreator was made because we had a shitty business partner who thought "everyone should be able to do every job". So he wanted me to have an easy way for all of my coworkers to edit menus without excel. Because literally not a single one knows excel. Fuck that guy.

This was made to make editing our bulk grams menu easier for everyone. The other menus in our store has a WIP program similiar to this but its not fleshed out enough for actual use.
