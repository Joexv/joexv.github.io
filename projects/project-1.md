summary: Our first mobile game. A fun simple rougelike textbased RPG
---

In a world filled with corrupt kings, door to door toaster salesmen, and lots of squirrels, there lies one thing that everyone loves. Torture. And what better way to torture adventurers who don't do your bidding? Throw them into a giant Tower and make them fight through hordes of goblins and demons to earn their freedom back.

You play as a retired adventurer who was just settling down to have a family, when your king decides to throw you in the Tower, for not obeying his orders. Now you must fight your way to the top of the Tower to earn back your freedom to see your family again!

Game play is simple! You "Dive" up a mysterious Tower collecting a massive collection of weapons, gold and potions, killing or sparing everything in your path. Will you help the lost squirrel running around the tower or will you disregard him and continue on your way?

Everything that happens in the Tower is random. You may experience a hoard of Boss Class monsters and have a very difficult time, or you may find nothing but treasure chests full of gold.

Tower Diver is our first ever mobile game. Our goal was to make something, simple, fun, and something that steered away from all the negatives of today's mobile gaming market.

By doing this, we do not have a pay to win structure, we do not shove ads down our user's throats, and we don't track or sell anything about our users.

Based on classic text based RPG's that we all knew and loved, Tower Diver brings back that gameplay into the modern gaming world, with game altering choices, hand drawn monster portraits, and squirrels!
