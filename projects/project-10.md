summary: No more bland browser shortcuts
---

Hate seeing that bland icon of your browser everytime you make a website shortcut on your desktop? Tired of manually having to find, download, set an icon up for each shortcut, and being abused by your parents?

Well sucks to be you I guess. Give this program a try and at least you won't have to the first couple of things.

 ICO Enumerator 5000 is a simple command line utility that will pull a PNG from https://icon.horse/ and set it as each shortcuts icon for you.
That's basically it. Cool. Thanks.
