summary: A tool to download and listen to Headspace Sounds
---
I'm not an a Headspace user, but I was dissapointed that you could not use a PC or even a web browser to listen to a majority of their library. This program will allow me to bring access to those who want to try Headspace but either don't have a mobile device or don't have access to their device during the night.
Features

Currently supports all 'Night' audio. Regular meditation and relaxation audios to be supported in the future. Sleepcasts, voice and background are mixed using FFMPEG into a single MP3. All other media is downloaded as AAC files. Audio is pulled using Headspace official servers using an official Headspace paid account. You CANNOT use this program for piracy as it requires a working current Bearer ID to authenticate with the server. This Bearer ID is unique to each account, and can easily be pulled by signing into Headspace on your web browser and using web dev tools to view any JSON request sent to the server. Without this authentication you cannot use the program period. It just won't work.

Currently, the program is contained in a single form, with a very basic audio player built in for ease of testing and checking media you download.

Headspace appears to change what voice/audio file Sleepcasts use on a daily basis. You can identify which audio you will get based on the Session ID. Some Wind Downs have multiple variations to their audio based on length of time, and narrator. These can be selected via a drop down box. Currently they are labeled as just a numerical ID, in the future these will idealy be labeled properly with narrator information and length of the audio.
Disclaimer

By making this program I am not promoting piracy or stealing of content from Headspace. They truely believe in what they create and that should be supported for making a service that helps many many people every day.
