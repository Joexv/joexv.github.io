summary: My series of Mini Pokemon ROM hacks
---

From my earliest memories, gaming has been a significant part of my life, thanks to my dad's passion for video games. Growing up in Japan, where my dad was stationed in the Air Force, I was introduced to the world of Pokemon from a very young age. In fact, I like to joke that I started playing Pokemon almost as soon as I was born, considering the game's release in 1996 coincided closely with my arrival into the world.

Inspired by my love for Pokemon and fueled by my desire to create my own gaming experiences, I embarked on a journey to develop my own Pokemon game. While I may not have been employed by Game Freak, I found my outlet through ROM hacking â€“ a close approximation to realizing my childhood dream. Throughout my teenage years, I dedicated myself to crafting various ROM hacks and developing tools to support the ROM hacking community.

Engaging in ROM hacking served as my entry point into the world of programming. Despite harboring an interest in programming prior to this endeavor, I lacked the means to explore it further. However, as I delved deeper into the intricacies of ROM hacking, I began to learn programming languages such as Assembly, C, and eventually C#. I even developed several tools in C# to aid fellow ROM hackers in their endeavors.

Through this immersive experience, I not only honed my programming skills but also cultivated a deep appreciation for the creativity and problem-solving inherent in game development. The journey from a Pokemon-loving kid to a proficient programmer and tool developer has been both rewarding and enlightening, laying the foundation for my future endeavors in the realm of technology and game development.

I made various Hacks too. The ones made public are listed below. Most of these have been updated since my last post on the forums, but there are no public links to these updated versions as of right now.
