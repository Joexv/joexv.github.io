summary: My series of Mini Pokemon ROM hacks
---

Growing up my dad was an avid gamer. Most of my early years in life were spent in Japan, when he was stationed there for the airforce.
He got me and my brother into Pokemon very early on. Like as soon as I was born early on.(Pokemon was first released in 1996, so he was able to start me right away).
One thing I always wanted to do growing up was make my own Pokemon game. Granteed I don't work for Game Freak so a ROM hack was about as close as I am gonna get.
I spent a few of my teen age years working on various ROM hacks and making tools to help the community.

Doing this was my first entry into programming as a whole, even though I had an interest in programming, I never really had a way to get into it.
Through out the time that I worked on Pokemon ROM Hacks I learned, Assembly, C, and C#. Making new tools in C#. Some of my more useful tools are linked below.
  
I made various Hacks too. The ones made public are listed below.
