## Overview
*Mechanics Inferno* is a short atmospheric platformer level designed within a hazardous industrial facility. Players navigate through mechanical obstacles, overcome environmental hazards, and strategically utilize power relays to open paths and disable threats as they work their way to the Core Control Room. Inspired by classic factory and machinery-based levels, this game idea emphasizes timing, skill, and strategic movement.

## Level Story
In *Mechanics Inferno*, players find themselves in a factory on the verge of a catastrophic meltdown. Due to massive system failures, the facility's machinery has gone rogue, and the safety systems have activated barriers to contain the damage. Players must ascend through multiple floors, overcome hazardous obstacles, and reach the Core Control Room before it's too late.

## Level Description
This is a 3D platformer experience, presented in an industrial setting with heavy machinery, ventilation shafts, and numerous conveyor belts. The level spans three distinct floors, each interconnected by staircases. Players start at the bottom of the factory and make their way to the Core Control Room at the top level. Along the way, they encounter various obstacles that challenge their timing, reflexes, and problem-solving abilities.

- **Main Objective:** Reach the Core Control Room to initiate an emergency shutdown.
- **Paths:** Three distinct paths provide varying challenges, hazards, and optional objectives, all leading to the same endpoint.
- **Obstacles:** Conveyor belts, gear lifts, and steam barriers that can be disabled through power relays.
- **Collectibles:** Hidden throughout the level, collectibles reward exploration and add depth to the challenge.

## Key Level Mechanics
1. **Conveyor Belts:** Sections of the level feature moving conveyor belts that affect player movement. Players must time their jumps and movements carefully to avoid being dragged into hazards.
   
2. **Power Relay Stations:** Critical points in the level allow players to activate or deactivate machinery, like shutting off steam barriers. These relays open new paths and make traversal safer by disabling certain threats temporarily.

3. **Gear Lifts:** Elevators made of rotating gears that players must jump on and off of to reach higher areas. Timing is crucial to avoid being thrown off or injured.

## Bubble Diagram
To visualize the flow of *Mechanics Inferno*, a bubble diagram was created, illustrating the level’s multi-floor structure, pathways, and key mechanics. Each path offers unique challenges, leading the player through hazards and collectibles, converging at the Core Control Room.

## Mood Boards
Each section of the level is inspired by iconic industrial environments. The starting area is dark and filled with inactive machinery, the middle paths feature intense mechanical noise and motion, while the end showcases the control room’s ominous lighting and energy fields. This design creates an immersive, escalating tension as players progress.
