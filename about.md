Hey, I’m Joe. By day I’m up to my elbows in computers, phones, servers and micro-soldering jobs at the repair shop I co-own and run. Nights don’t change me I’m still me—but I swap broken hardware for broken code. I spend my free time tinkering on personal projects: small games to learn new languages, mods to tweak the classics I play, or fan-made adventures inspired by Pokemon. Game design may be my official career path now, but I’ve been building design work into my portfolio for years.

My dad was an IT guy way before tech was cool. After the Air Force he dove into programming, made early email clients, then pivoted to video games. One standout memory: he gathered our Boy Scout troop’s drawings, scanned them in, and turned our doodles into a 2D platformer. Seeing his passion shaped me—so I learned every language I could, from Assembly and PowerShell to C# and Powershell scripts. But code alone wasn’t enough. I realized that without a design focus, my creations only appealed to me. Design school plugged that gap and let me carry on my dad’s legacy.

I’ve had a blast crafting basic prototypes, mechanic showcases, and design docs as I explore the games I want to build. My final capstone was an action roguelike that blew past scope. Thankfully, I teamed up with someone I’d worked with before and dove deep into combat, AI and polish. We learned that roguelikes are brutal for consistent feedback, but the lessons on scope, iteration and teamwork were priceless.

When I’m not soldering or scripting, you’ll catch me perfecting my Yu‑Gi‑Oh! deck (Ojama or Orcust mains, dont @ me), chasing my toddler around the house, or sketching level flowcharts on sticky notes. If you’ve got a wild game idea or need someone to wrangle your servers, let’s build something fun.

Feel free to browse my projects, or say howdy do.
