    "summary": "Creative and technically versatile game designer with a strong foundation in systems programming and over a decade of professional IT and development experience. I specialize in designing immersive gameplay systems, level layouts, and interactive features, with a deep understanding of both user experience and backend logic.\n\nThroughout my career, I’ve worked across infrastructure, scripting, and automation—now I apply that same problem-solving mindset to game design. Currently completing my Bachelor’s in Game Design at Full Sail University, I’ve contributed to projects spanning level design, gameplay systems, and tool development—building everything from stealth mechanics and physics mockups to UI tools and player-driven systems. \n\nMy strengths lie in rapid prototyping, tool-driven development, and creating systems that make sense to both players and designers.",
