    I’m a systems-driven designer who builds weird ideas that feel surprisingly intuitive. 
    Whether it’s modular level design, combat scripting, or dynamic UI flow, I love turning messy concepts into gameplay that just clicks. If it supports experimentation, player expression, or feels slightly cursed—I’m into it.
    Before pivoting into game design, I spent over a decade in IT solving real-world technical chaos across government, healthcare, and finance. That background sharpened my debugging instincts, taught me how to translate complexity into clarity, and made me the go-to bridge between technical and creative minds.
    Outside of development, you’ll find me falling off rocks, cooking something I probably shouldn’t, or deep in a PlayStation 2-era classic. Games are puzzles, toys, systems, and stories all at once—and I try to bring a little bit of each into everything I make.
