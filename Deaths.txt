They were too busy playing Fashion Souls,
They pressed the wrong God Damn button,

They missed 42 backstabs in a row and then got parried,
They rolled off the map while dodging a dung pie,
They back stepped off a cliff,
They were busy checking out how THICCC dancer is and got hit hawrd,
They died to Pinwheel,
They got summoned and then fell off a ladder,
They got cursed,
Cursy boi hands grabbed that ass a bit too hard,
Suicide is badass,
They spammed 'B' during a conversation and ended up back-stepping off a cliff,
They did a whoosh when they should've done a blip and then a blap,
They got stun locked by a weak ass hollow,
They didn't feel up to killing a limping Sif,
Fucking bitch ass miracle build,
WTF WHY WAS THAT ENEMY THERE THEY NEVER DO THAT,
They are super drunk,
They thought they were better than they actually are,
It was Karen’s fault,
